django-quest
============

The quest maker I've written for my sister's birthday. Do you make a scavenger
hunt and need to store tasks somewhere? You would like this project then!

The application requires Python 3.7+ and Django.

To create a game:

	* pipenv install,

	* edit and copy project/project/local_settings.py.example to
	  project/project/local_settings.py,
	
	* manage.py migrate,

	* create a superuser and run the server,

	* enter in /admin via web-browser,

	* create quest levels (at least one is required) in an admin page,

	* try to solve the quest and get gz emojis!

Notes: when you are logged as an admin you can jump between levels without
writing an answer, HTMLs are written in Russian but they are so simple that you
can edit them yourself in a gamers' language.

Contact with me at last commit author's email and read LICENSE file (it's
Apache 2) if you need to be calm the code is free as in speech.
