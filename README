The quest maker I've written for my sister's birthday

To launch it you should be familiar with Django projects.

	* pipenv install,

	* edit and copy project/project/local_settings.py.example to
	  project/project/local_settings.py,
	
	* manage.py migrate,

	* create a superuser and run the server,

	* enter in /admin as a superuser via web-browser,

	* create quest levels (at least one is required) in an admin page,

	* try to solve the quiz yourself and get gz emojis!

Note: when you are logged as an admin you can jump between levels without
requiring to solve them.
